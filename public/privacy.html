Where you choose to do this, we will receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider. The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make public on such a social media platform. If you log in using Facebook, we may also request access to other permissions related to your account, such as your friends, check-ins, and likes, and you may choose to grant or deny us access to each individual permission.</p>
                <p>We will use the information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services.

                <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                <h2 id="section9">9. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
                <p class="in-short"><strong>In Short:</strong> You may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your country, province, or state of residence.</p>
                <p><strong>Withdrawing your consent:</strong> If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#section16" class="text-violet-600 hover:underline">"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?"</a> below.</p>
                <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful processing grounds other than consent.</p>
                <h3>Account Information</h3>
                <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>

                <h2 id="section10">10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>
                <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>

                <h2 id="section11">11. DO OTHER REGIONS HAVE SPECIFIC PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>
                <p class="in-short"><strong>In Short:</strong> You may have additional rights based on the country you reside in.</p>
                <h3>Australia</h3>
                <p>We collect and process your personal information under the obligations and conditions set by Australia's Privacy Act 1988 (Privacy Act).</p>
                <p>This Privacy Notice satisfies the notice requirements defined in the Privacy Act, in particular: what personal information we collect from you, from which sources, for which purposes, and other recipients of your personal information.</p>
                <p>If you do not wish to provide the personal information necessary to fulfill their applicable purpose, it may affect our ability to provide our services, in particular:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>offer you the products or services that you want</li>
                    <li>respond to or help with your requests</li>

                    <li>confirm your identity and protect your account</li>
                </ul>
                <p>At any time, you have the right to request access to or correction of your personal information. You can make such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section <a href="#section17" class="text-violet-600 hover:underline">"HOW CAN YOU REVIEW, UPDATE, OR DELETE THE DATA WE COLLECT FROM YOU?"</a></p>
                <p>If you believe we are unlawfully processing your personal information, you have the right to submit a complaint about a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles to the <a href="https://www.oaic.gov.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="text-violet-600 hover:underline">Office of the Australian Information Commissioner</a>.</p>

                <h2 id="section12">12. INFORMATION PROCESSED ON BEHALF OF OUR USERS (DATA PROCESSOR ROLE)</h2>
                <p>Our Service, by its nature, processes communications between our users (the business owners) and their customers (the end-users). In this context, our user is the 'Data Controller' who determines the purposes and means of processing personal data, and AI Inbox acts as the 'Data Processor' on their behalf. We only process end-user data in accordance with the instructions of our users, as dictated by the business information they provide and the core functionality of the Service.</p>

                <h2 id="section13">13. AI MODEL DATA PROCESSING AND SUB-PROCESSORS</h2>
                <p>To provide our core AI messaging service, we use third-party AI models from service providers such as OpenAI. When a response is generated, we may send relevant data, including the text of end-user messages, conversation history, and the user's business information, to these providers. We have configured our integration to prevent this data from being used for training the third-party's public AI models. Our use of these sub-processors is solely for the purpose of generating responses as part of the service requested by the user.</p>

                <h2 id="section14">14. INTERNATIONAL DATA TRANSFERS</h2>
                <p>Your information may be stored and processed in any country where we have facilities or in which we engage service providers, including the United States. By using our Service, you understand that your information will be transferred to countries outside of your country of residence, which may have data protection rules that are different from those of your country. We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2 id="section15">15. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h2>
                <p class="in-short"><strong>In Short:</strong> Yes, we will update this notice as necessary to stay compliant with relevant laws.</p>

If we make material changes to this Privacy Notice, we may notify you either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this Privacy Notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting your information.</p>
